<h1>osTicket - Prerequisites and Installation</h1>
This tutorial outlines the prerequisites and installation of the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket. 

<h2>Part 1: Creating A Vitrual Machine in Azure Cloud</h2>
osTicket can be installed on your own computer; however, we will be using a virtual machine for this installation.

To begin creating a virtual machine in Azure Cloud, we will need to set up a subscription with Azure. 
Link:   https://portal.azure.com

Once you have your subscription created, you should see a screen look that looks similar to this or  you can navigate to  https://portal.azure.com/#home

Next we will click on Resource Group Icon to name and create a resource group. I have given my resource group the name “osTicket-lab” but you can name it whatever you like.

Once you follow through by clicking the various prompts to review and create your resource group, the deployment of your resource group should begin. Just remember to take note of the resource group region. It will be very important in optimizing networking capabilities. <br>
